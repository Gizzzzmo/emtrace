# Emtrace

Super fast (benchmarks WIP), minimal overhead, tracing / logging library for multiple languages
(currently C/C++ and Rust). All processing of logged information (like formatting) is deferred; the
application only sends out those bytes that are relevant to what you are trying to log and that
aren't known at compile time. By default this data is written to stdout, but in general the output
channel is completely customizable.

## Usage

Choose the language you want to use below. Once you have a compiled binary (regardless of source
language) you can run it, and pipe its output into [`emtrace.py`](./emtrace.py), to which you also
have to supply the path to the same binary. E.g. something like this (assuming your executable is
a.out):

```bash
./a.out | python path/to/emtrace.py a.out
```

The script is more efficient, when you have pyelftools installed, but it also works without it. It
has a few extra options that you can checkout by running `python emtrace.py -h`

### In C

The library currently consists of [a single header](./c/include/c/include/emtrace/emtrace.h). Simply
download, and include it (works out of the gate with gcc, and clang).

```c
#include <emtrace/emtrace.h>

int main(void) {
    EMTRACE_INIT();
    EMTRACELN("Hello World!");

    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
    EMTRACELN_F("{} + {} = {}", int, a, int, b, int, a + b);
}
```

### In Rust

I've not yet published anything on crates.io. So you will need to clone this repository for now if
you want to use it.

```rust
use emtrace::{init, traceln};

fn main() {
    init(&mut std::io::stdout().lock());
    traceln!("Hello World!");

    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    traceln!("{} + {} = {}", i32: a, i32: b, i32: a + b);
}
```

## How it works

All information needed to display the trace is written, at compile time, to a dedicated section of
the output binary (`.emtrace` section by default, currently only supports ELF executables). Only
data that can change at runtime is actually (barely) processed then, and sent out along with a
pointer to associate it to the right piece of format information in this dedicated section. The
section can be completely removed (or made no-load) from the final binary (e.g. with objcopy), and
the program will still run.

The [post-processing script](./emtrace.py) takes the data output by the program while running and
the data from the special `.emtrace` section, and produces the log.

## Development

If you want to tinker with the code, and need to figure out how to build, lint, and test it check
out [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (also useful for some ðŸŒˆ*vibe-coding*ðŸŒˆ). The easiest way to get a working
development environment is to use the provided [nix flake](./flake.nix).

## Comparison

There are a few other projects who do something smiliar. This table presents a comparison to those I
know, and have tried:

- [defmt](https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt)

  - \+ much more mature
  - \+ supports different kinds of encodings
  - \+ more efficient packing of format info into ELF (unfortunately I don't see how the mechanism
    they use could be workable in the C version)
  - \- always requires a custom linker script
  - \- only works in rust

- [trice](https://github.com/rokath/trice)

  - \+ more mature
  - \+ supports different kinds of encodings
  - \- preprocessing of source files is a required step
  - \- only works in C/C++

## TODO

- [x] add basic documentation
- [x] add license
- [ ] make rust's init function + magic_bytes variable into a macro to support different section
  names
- [x] complete adding support for tracing nested types (lists, tuples, etc.) on post-processing side
- [ ] switch C tests from using `assert` to something else and combine all tests into a single
  executable
- [x] add usage examples to documentation
- [x] add download / install instructions to documentation
- [x] add basic tests
- [ ] add more detailed documentation
- [ ] split the above todo item into separate items for separate features
- [x] push to github
- [ ] add some basic benchmarks
- [ ] add CI pipeline (github actions?)
- [ ] add dedicated C++ implementation
- [x] add CMake profile-switching to justfile
- [ ] add versioning information
- [ ] publish rust crate to crates.io
- [ ] add nix build recipe and publish to nixpkgs
- [ ] make CMake version installable, add conan recipe, and publish to conan center
- [ ] add compatibility with other binary formats (mach-o and pe)
